<!--
This input demonstrates
whether sub-modules are given differnt cut-offs.

The input must be run with cut-off 6 on the cut set order.
Some very expensive module must be given for gate "r1" in this input.
If the "r1" gate is analyzed with cut-off 6,
the analysis treats all sub-modules as a top module
and does extra computation.
If the "r1" is analyzed with cut-off 1,
the analysis computes sub-module cut sets only as necessary.

Note that preprocessing techniques may prune the graph
and correctly handle this demonstration.
In this case, the analysis algorithms
may not have a chance to demonstrate its work.

Also note that gate coalescing techniques may mess the demonstration.
